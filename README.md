# How Universities enroll students in China

Image university as busses, students as passangers. One bus can only take certain amount of passangers, and the amount might be different if it's a different bus or the bus is in a different province. Passangers can choose what busses they want to get in, and rank them in order.

All Students stay in a line based on their rank of grade of their college entrance examination in their home province. Namely, each province has a student line, and they don't affect each other. However, a student's rank might move up because some special treatments.

When the admission begins, provincial higher education enrollment office will examinate students from the first one in the line to the last. For each student, let's say we have student A. A has a list of universities(bus1 to bus6) he/she want to get in, if bus1 still have vacancies, A will be get into bus1, otherwise examinate if bus2 has vacancies. If after examinating bus6, there is still no vacancies for A, A will need to wait until all the students in the line finishes the examination, then apply again.

When the last student in the line get in the bus, now it's bus' turn. Actually, busses will get more passangers in the bus than they can afford. For example, a bus can take 20 people, but it will take 30 instead in the first round, which means, 10 students will need to get off the bus. Universities will examinate the students based on their subject scores and the majors they apply.

For those who get off the bus or don't get in the bus, they will need to wait until  all the buses finish their admission in this stage, and apply again if there is anything left.

Therefore, It's extremely important for a student to get in the bus and stay.
